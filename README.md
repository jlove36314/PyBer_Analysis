# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of the new analysis is to create a summary dataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Results

From the data above we can see that the Total rides, Total drivers and total Fares increase as expected as the poputaltion density increases per city type.  We can also see that there are less drivers/per rider in rural areas causing Average fares per rider & average fares per driver to increase in rural settings.   

## Summary

In summation, there are some disparities between urban and Rural settings. 

Most notable:

- drivers per riders
- fares per rider
- fares per driver

Ways to offset these could be the following:

- Inform drivers of the high fares per driver in rural areas, trying to recriut more drivers in rural settings
- focus marketing budget to try to increse urban riders
- Create a subscription base model where all users pay the same fees based on average fares between all city types
